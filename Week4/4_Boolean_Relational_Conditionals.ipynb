    "## Control Structure\n",
    "A control structure is a logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements\n",
    "execute.\n",
    "#### Sequence Structure\n",
    "A sequence structure is a set of statements that execute in the order in\n",
    "which they appear. For example, the following code is a sequence structure because the statements\n",
    "execute from top to bottom:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> name = input('What is your name? ')\n",
    "> age = int(input('What is your age? '))\n",
    "> print('Here is the data you entered:')\n",
    "> print('Name:', name)\n",
    "> print('Age:', age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the sequence structure is heavily used in programming, it cannot handle every\n",
    "type of task. This is because some problems simply cannot be solved by performing a set\n",
    "of ordered steps, one after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Structure (selection structure)\n",
    "In a decision structure’s simplest form, a specific action is performed only if a certain condition\n",
    "exists. If the condition does not exist, the action is not performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will refer to the first line as the if clause. The if clause begins with\n",
    "the word if, followed by a condition, which is an expression that will be evaluated\n",
    "as either true or false. A colon appears after the condition. Beginning at the next line\n",
    "is a block of statements. A block is simply a set of statements that belong together as a\n",
    "group. Notice in the general format that all of the statements in the block are indented.\n",
    "This indentation is required because the Python interpreter uses it to tell where the block\n",
    "begins and ends"

    "2. The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, the month times the day equals the year: 6/10/60. Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two- digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic.\n",

Write a program that calculates the number of packages of hot dogs and the number of packages of hot dog buns needed for a cookout, with the minimum amount of leftovers. The program should ask the user for the number of people attending the cookout and the number of hot dogs each person will be given. The program should display the following details:\n",

    "    - If a customer purchases less than 2 books, he or she earns 0 points.\n",
    "    - If a customer purchases 2 or more books, but less than 4, he or she earns 5 points.\n",
