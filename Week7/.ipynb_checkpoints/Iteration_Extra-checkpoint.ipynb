    "There is a conditional execution structure built into Python to handle these types of expected and unexpected errors called “try / except”. The idea of `try` and `except` is that you know that some sequence of instruction(s) may have a problem and you want to add some statements to be executed if an error occurs. These extra statements (the except block) are ignored if there is no error."
