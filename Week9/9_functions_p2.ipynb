    "### Tips\n",
    "Most programmers agree that you should restrict the use of global variables, or not use\n",
    "them at all. The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Global variables make debugging difficult. Any statement in a program file can change\n",
    "the value of a global variable. If you find that the wrong value is being stored in a\n",
    "global variable, you have to track down every statement that accesses it to determine\n",
    "where the bad value is coming from. In a program with thousands of lines of code,\n",
    "this can be difficult.\n",
    "2. Functions that use global variables are usually dependent on those variables. If you\n",
    "want to use such a function in a different program, most likely you will have to redesign\n",
    "it so it does not rely on the global variable.\n",
    "3. Global variables make a program hard to understand. A global variable can be modified\n",
    "by any statement in the program. If you are to understand any part of the program\n",
    "that uses a global variable, you have to be aware of all the other parts of the\n",
    "program that access the global variable.\n",
