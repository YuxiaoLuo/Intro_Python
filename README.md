# Introduction to Programming in Python

The learning material is created by [Yuxiao Luo](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo) and related to the undergraduate course CIS2300 (Programming and Computational Thinking) provided at the Department of Information Systems and Statistics, Baruch College.

Instructor: [Yuxiao Luo](https://github.com/YuxiaoLuo)

## Course Description 
This course is intended to introduce how to use Python to program and write the basic algorithm. This course will cover fundamental principles and concepts required for problem-formulation and problem-solving, and not just programming. The goal of this course is to equip students with the basic ability to use computational principles such as iteration, abstraction, recursion, and functional decomposition. This course will introduce students to basic programming constructs such as control statements and data structures to facilitate learning of these computational principles. This is an introductory course intended for students with little or no programming background.
