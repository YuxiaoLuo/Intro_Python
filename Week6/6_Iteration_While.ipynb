    "1. Budget Analysis. Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he/she has budgeted for a month.\n",
    "- A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running total.\n",
    "- When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount and the percentage that the user is over or under budget, using if statement. (e.g. You exceeded your budget by 400 dollars (20 percent)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify the Budget Analysis program in #1 so that\n",
    "\n",
    "- when the user enters a value for the budget or for the expense amounts, that's not a positive number, the program will display a message saying he/she needs to enter a positive number.\n",
    "- the output at the end needs to be displayed with $ or % sign, 2 decimal places, and a thousand separator where applicable.\n",

    "3. Tuition Increase. Write a program that asks the user for the current year, the current tuition for a full-time student, and the tuition increase rate for each year in the next 5 years (the same rate is used for all 5 years. e.g., 3% increase rate for each year for the next 5 years). The program should then display the 5 projected tuition amounts for the next 5 years.\n",

    "4. Modify the Tuition Increase program in #3 so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the user's input for the tuition increase rate has to be a positive number, and has to be entered in fractions (e.g., the user needs to enter 0.03 if the increase rate is 3%)\n",
    "- the user's input for the current tuition has to be a positive number\n",
    "- the output would be similar to below (hint: you can use \\t in your print statement for creating extra spaces between the year number and the tuition amount (\\t = 4 spaces or 1 tab)).\n",

    "- Write a program that displays the number of calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.  \n",
    "- The program should then also ask the user how many calories he/she wants to burn, and then display how many minutes the user needs to exercise to achieve that goal.\n"
