    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- objects: An object is a software entity that contains both data and procedures.\n",
    "    - attributes (data): data contained in an object is object's data attributes. Object's data attributes are variables that reference data.\n",

    "- benefits of OOP\n",
    "    - prevents accidental data corruption\n",
    "    - changes to object's internal data attributes \n",
