    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Object oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is centered on objects, which are created from datatypes containing data and functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- objects: An object is a software entity that contains both data and procedures.\n",
    "    - attributes (data): data contained in an object is object's data attributes. Object's data attributes are variables that reference data.\n",
    "    - methods (procedures/functions): procedures that an object performs are methods, while the object's methods are function that operates on object's data attributes.\n",

    "    - data and code combined in a single object \n",
    "- data hiding\n",

    "- benefits of OOP\n",
    "    - prevents accidental data corruption\n",
    "    - changes to object's internal data attributes \n",
